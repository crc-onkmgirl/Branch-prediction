To compile the code, simply use command "make".
Saturating-counter's parameters m and k are read from config.txt. For different m and k, have to edit config file.

%% The original config.txt contains m and k in one line, and i did not realize there was a config_new on NYU_CLASS until i was going to submit it. And i was not able to change my code because of it was very close to due. So to make the code run, m and k must be in one line in config file. Sorry for that.%%

The code reads trace.txt line by line, and outputs the prediction of PHT for current instruction in the pc in trace.txt.out in corresponding line.
